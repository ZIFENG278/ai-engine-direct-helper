## Introduction
This guide helps developers setup C++ environment for using QAI AppBuilder to run sample code on Windows on Snapdragon (WoS) platforms.You should install [Visual Studio 2022 or higher](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) ,[Cmake](https://cmake.org/download/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win).
During the  Visual Studio installation process, you will be asked to choose the workloads you want and customize your installation. 
**At a minimum, selmake sure to checkÔºö**
* **Desktop development with C++**.

##  1.File Download & Setup Instructions
First, create a directory named `real_esrgan_x4plus` at any location (e.g., ai-engine-direct-helper\samples\c++\real_esrgan_x4plus). 
The final project structure should look like this:
```plaintext
real_esrgan_x4plus/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ QAI_AppBuilder-win_arm64-QNN2.34.0-Release/   # QNN SDK
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/                                       # Model files (e.g., .bin)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ qai_libs/                                     # QNN SDK runtime libraries (e.g., HTP backend)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ build/                                        # Directory generated after successful compilation; contains the real_esrgan_x4plus.exe binary.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ real_esrgan_x4plus.cpp                        # C++ inference main program
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ input.jpg                                     # Sample input jpg
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CMakeLists.txt                                # CMake configuration 
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                                     # Project documentation
```
**NOTE: During runtime, the Release/ directory serves as the working directory. All relative paths within the application are resolved with respect to this directory.**
#### Step 1: Download QAI Launcher
Open a terminal and run:
```
mkdir C:\ai-hub\
cd C:\ai-hub\
```
Click here to download [QAI_Launcher_v1.0.0.zip](https://github.com/quic/ai-engine-direct-helper/releases/download/v2.34.0/QAI_Launcher_v1.0.0.zip). Unzip the downloaded file into the **C:\ai-hub** directory.
Run the following script to install all required dependencies and tools:
```
.\1.Install_QAI_AppBuilder.bat
```
Then navigate to:
```
ai-engine-direct-helper/samples/
```
Copy the entire **`qai_libs`/** folder into your local `real_esrgan_x4plus`/ project directory.

#### Step 2: Download Real_Esrgan_X4plus file
The essential files needed for `real_esrgan_x4plus` model inference are already downloaded when you run `real_esrgan_x4plus.py` after launching the Python environment via **8.Start_PythonEnv.bat**.
So, there‚Äôs no need to re-download them‚Äîyou just need to locate and copy them into the correct locations.
Open a terminal in C:\ai-hub\Ôºåand run:
```
.\8.Start_PythonEnv.bat
pip install py3-wget==1.0.12
cd ../ai-engine-direct-helper/samples
python python\real_esrgan_x4plus\real_esrgan_x4plus.py
```
**Note: All operations in this step are performed inside the virtual environment py312, which is automatically created and activated by 8.Start_PythonEnv.bat.**
Then navigate to:
```
ai-engine-direct-helper/samples/python/real_esrgan_x4plus/
```
Copy the following files into your local `real_esrgan_x4plus`/ directory:
* **`models`/** folder (contains the real_esrgan_x4plus model (`real_esrgan_x4plus.bin`) files)
* **`input.jpg`** (sample image for inference)

Place all files in the appropriate directories under your local `real_esrgan_x4plus`/ project folder to ensure the inference script can access them correctly.


#### Step 3: Download QAI_AppBuilder

Click here to download [QAI_AppBuilder-win_arm64-QNN2.34.0-Release](https://github.com/quic/ai-engine-direct-helper/releases/download/v2.34.0/QAI_AppBuilder-win_arm64-QNN2.34.0-Release.zip).Unzip the contents of the archive into the `QAI_AppBuilder-win_arm64-QNN2.34.0-Release`/ folder inside your `real_esrgan_x4plus`/ project directory. The structure should look like:
```plaintext
real_esrgan_x4plus/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ QAI_AppBuilder-win_arm64-QNN2.34.0-Release/
```



## 2.Install Dependencies
#### Note:
All the following operations are not performed inside the py312 virtual environment.
If you're running the commands directly from this README, make sure to launch your command prompt from the root of drive C (C:\) before executing the steps below.If you're not in C:\, you will need to modify the command paths accordingly.
### 2.1 Setup vcpkg

#### 1.Clone the vcpkg Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
cd vcpkg
.\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
```
#### 2.Add to PATH
Add the full path to the vcpkg directory (e.g., C:\vcpkg) to your system PATH so you can run vcpkg from any terminal.

### 2.2 Setup xtensor
Run below command in Windows terminal:
```
vcpkg install xtensor
```
* If the download is too slow, you can download via the link.Put all the downloaded files in the the vcpkg directory (e.g., C:\vcpkg\dowloads).Then run the command again.


### 2.3 Build OpenCV for ARM64

OpenCV ARM64 support includes two build methods:
* Using vcpkg for package-based installation and configuration
* Building from source via GitHub with CMake and Visual Studio
  
For complete instructions, including configuration flags, patching steps, and troubleshooting tips, please refer to the following guide:
üìÑ [Full OpenCV ARM64 Build Guide](../dependency/opencv)

### 3.Run Application
##### Preparation
Before building and running the application, ensure that:
* The **real_esrgan_x4plus/** directory contains all required files, including:
  * `CMakeLists.txt` (see configuration below)
  * `real_esrgan_x4plus.cpp` and any additional source files
  * All required model files and DLLs are in their correct locations
* All DLL paths, model/image paths, and other hardcoded paths in your `real_esrgan_x4plus.cpp` and CMakeLists.txt are updated to match your environment.The specific steps to update these paths are provided below.
#### Step 1: Setup CMakeLists.txt and Source Code
##### 1. Configure `CMakeLists.txt`
Make sure to modify the following path settings in your CMakeLists.txt file to match your local environment:
```
# ‚ùó Replace these with the actual paths where your OpenCV is installed:
set(OPENCV_ROOT ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/opencv)
include_directories(${OPENCV_ROOT}/include)
link_directories(${OPENCV_ROOT}/Release)
link_directories(${OPENCV_ROOT}/lib)
```
* These paths configure the include directories, DLL binaries, and static library locations for OpenCV. If your setup differs, be sure to update accordingly.
* If OpenCV is installed via vcpkg, The following CMake code will automatically locate the path to the OpenCV library.
  ```
  find_package(OpenCV REQUIRED COMPONENTS core imgproc highgui imgcodecs videoio)
  ```
##### 2. Update Paths in Source Code
Inside your `real_esrgan_x4plus.cpp` file, modify the hardcoded paths to match the location of your model and runtime libraries. For example:
```
// ‚ùó Update these paths to reflect your actual file locations
fs::path execution_ws = fs::current_path();
fs::path backend_lib_path = execution_ws / "QnnHtp.dll";
fs::path system_lib_path = execution_ws / "QnnSystem.dll";
fs::path model_path = execution_ws / (MODEL_NAME + ".bin");
fs::path input_path = execution_ws / "input.jpg";
fs::path output_path = execution_ws / "output.jpg";
```

* These paths are currently relative paths, which means they are resolved relative to the location of the executable (`real_esrgan_x4plus.exe`) generated in the Release/ directory.
If your files are not placed in the expected locations relative to Release/, you will need to adjust these paths accordingly or use absolute paths instead.
##### Special Note ‚Äì For source-built OpenCV only
If you compiled OpenCV from source (not using vcpkg), you must explicitly tell CMake where your OpenCV installation is located before calling find_package. You should also add a post-build step so that the OpenCV runtime DLLs are automatically copied into the same folder as your executable.
**Note:** Replace the placeholder paths below (C:/path/to/opencv/...) with the actual install location and bin folder from your own OpenCV build.
* ##### Step 1 
  In CMakeLists.txt (around line 56, before find_package(OpenCV ...)), add:
``` 
set(OpenCV_DIR "C:/path/to/opencv/build_msvc/install") <=New added
set(OpenCV_BIN_DIR "C:/path/to/opencv/build_msvc/install/ARM64/vc17/bin") <=New added
find_package(OpenCV REQUIRED COMPONENTS core imgproc highgui imgcodecs videoio)
```
* ##### Step 2 
   In the final copy section of CMakeLists.txt (**append** to your existing add_custom_command):
```
# === [New Added] === Post-build step to copy all OpenCV DLLs into the exe's output folder
add_custom_command(TARGET ${PROJECT_NAME} POST_BUILD
  COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E copy_directory
          "${OpenCV_BIN_DIR}"
          $<TARGET_FILE_DIR:${PROJECT_NAME}>
```
#####  3. Build the Project with CMake 
Open the Windows Command Prompt (CMD) as Administrator, then navigate to the project root directory and run the following command to configure the build:
```bash
cmake -B "build" ^
      -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" ^
      -A ARM64 ^
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ^
      -DCMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY=bin
```

#### Step 2: Build the Application
```bash
cmake --build "build" --config Release
```

#### Step 3: Run the Application
In the Windows terminal, navigate to the Release folder and run:
```
cd build\bin\Release
./WoA_Real_Esrgan_x4plus.exe
```
#### Step 4: Verifying Successful Execution
If the following files are generated, it indicates that `WoA_Real_Esrgan_x4plus.exe` has run successfully:
```
output.jpg
```
To simplify the operation flow, you can replace 'Run Application' by copying the following script(`clean_config_build_run.bat`) to the `real_esrgan_x4plus` folder and running it with administrator privileges. This script will automatically execute CMake's configuration and build process, then run the generated `WoA_Real_Esrgan_x4plus.exe`.
```
